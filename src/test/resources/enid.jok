Rules for "Enid" - A card game for 2 to 5 players
=================================================

The game of Enid developed over a number of late nights towards the
end of last term and start of this; it is based on the classic
card-game "Blackjack", but we hold it to be more educational, since it
has strong influences from the fields of computer science, piscatorial
zoology and english literature.

For the benefit of those readers not acquainted with the relatively
pedestrian game of Blackjack, a summary follows.  Those who already
know this game can skip straight to the section detailing the ways in
which Enid differs from Blackjack, after the dashed line.

In Blackjack, each player is dealt a hand of seven cards, and the
remainder of the deck is placed face down on the table, except for one
card which is turned face up.  The first player to get rid of all his
(or her; throughout this article, masculine pronouns are used in a
non-gender-specific sense) cards is the winner.  A player loses a card
by placing it face up on top of the current face-up card; it must
follow either suit or rank except in special circumstances mentioned
below.

Play starts with the player to the left of the dealer, and passes to
the left until one player has one.  Any player unable to take his turn
must instead draw the top card from the face-down deck.  When this
deck is exhausted, it is replenished from the stock of face-up cards.

This is "natural" Blackjack.  As it stands it is a rather dull game;
thus it is enhanced by the addition of "magic" cards.  That is, cards
of certain rank have special effects.  These are:

	Ace:	The player playing an ace nominates a new suit, which
		the next play must follow.

	Two:	The next player is forced to pick up two cards unless
		he is able to lay another two, in which case the
		player after must pick up four cards.  If he is able
		to play another two, he may do this instead, in which
		case the next player picks up six, etc.

	Seven:	The direction of play is reversed.

	Eight:	The player who laid the eight MUST immediately follow
		it with ANY OTHER CARD in his hand; the second card
		need not follow suit or rank as in the usual case.
		It the player is unable to follow an eight (ie. it was
		his last card) he must draw from the deck.

	Ten:	The player may lay any or all cards from his hand which
		are of the same suit as the Ten just laid.

	Jack:	A black Jack causes he next player to pick up seven
		cards, unless he can follow with  a red jack (which
		neutralises the blackjack) or another black jack, in
		which case the next player must draw fourteen cards,
		unless able to lay a red jack.

	Queen:	The next player is skipped.

	King:	The next two players are skipped.

One last rule is that a player with only a single card left must say
"Last card" as soon as he has laid his last-but-one; otherwise he must
pick up seven, in an astonishingly witty way.

This, then, is the usual game of Blackjack.  Some regional variations
exist in the exact powers of the magic cards, but those listed above
are typical, and make a balanced and witty game.

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

In a different league altogether, however, is Enid.  This builds on
the usual rules in a number of ways.  Firstly, the suits are renamed;
no longer are they Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds, but Carp,
Sturgeon, Halibut and Dalmations.  (The dalmation is, of course, not a
fish, but is included for historical reasons).  Secondly the card
ranks are renamed after eminent computer scientists:

  Black	Ace:	Rob McMahon	   (Warwick computer Unit's SuperGuru)
    Red	Ace:	Jeff Smith	   (Warwick computer Department's Guru)
	Two:	Marvin Minsky	   (AI pioneer and researcher)
	Three:	Denis M Richie	   (Co-inventor of C and UNIX)
	Four:	Brian W Kernighan  (Co-inventor of C)
	Five:	Tarski		   (aka. "The Boring One")
	Six:	Alan Turing	   (Pioneer of computational theory)
	Seven:	Alonzo Church	   (as in the Church-Turing thesis)
	Eight:	Aho/Sethi/Hopcroft/Ullman   (Authors who only ever
						work together)
	Nine:	Terry Wogan	   (Not really a computer scientist)
	Ten:	Terry Winograd	   (Natural language researcher)
  Black Jack:	Mark Rafter	   (Warwick C++ guru)
    Red Jack:	John Buckle	   (Warwick frisbee guru)
	Queen:	Julia Dain	   (Warwick compiler-design guru)
	King:	Ken Thompson	   (The inventor of UNIX)

Obviously, people form other establishments may wish to rename the
Aces, Jacks and Queen after local people.  For historical reasons, the
red aces are always referred to as "Jeffy-pheasant(sic) without
/cs/res", the King as "Kendall Mint Thompson", and the Queen EITHER as
"Julia Dain", "Julia Ordain", "Julia Hors d'Ouvre" or "Julia Hors
d'Ouvre which must be obeyed as all times".  The Ten may be referred
to as the "Terry Winograd", "Terry who Mage can't pronounce", or "The
block who wrote SHRDLU".  Mage can't pronounce "Winograd".

To encourage the use of these new names, each card played must be
named by the player as it is laid, without reading it off a list.
This is difficult at first, and tends to discourage the over-use of
the eight, but in time becomes second nature.  Any player unable to
name his card is forced to draw from the pack, and the card's "magic"
effect, if any, is nullified.

Whenever a Denis Richie or a Brian Kernighan is played, the player
must make up a middle name, beginning with the appropriate initial,
which may not be re-used later in the same session of play, on pain of
being forced, once again, to draw from the deck.  The middle names may
not be proper nouns unless they are really good ones.

Whenever an Alonzo Church is played, reversing the direction of play,
the player laying the card must shout triumphantly at the player who
*would* have played next, had the Church not been played: "Haaargh!
Be Alonzo Churched! (a bit)".

Anybody playing a black Alan Turing may force the next player to
compose and recite a limerick, the first line being chosen by the
player laying the Alan Turing, unless this player can follow the
Turing with another black Alan Turing, which passes the limerick onto
the next player, or a red one, which cancels it entirely.  If it
doesn't scan or rhyme properly, or is just no good, the other players
may elect to force the poet to draw from the deck anyway.

The card from which the game draws its name is, of course, the Enid
Blyton.  This card is always a nine, and its suit during any game is
determined by the suit of the first card to be turned over at the
start of the game.  The enid is a kind of "smart-bomb" among cards -
it can gets its possessor out of almost anything, for instance a Mark
Rafter can be annulled not only by a John Buckle (to the ritual cry of
"My John Buckle casts your Mark Rafter to type VOID!"), but also by
the Enid Blyton.  Similarly, the Enid can cancel any number of
consecutive Marvin Minskys, or indeed Alan Turings.

Another property of the Enid Blyton is that if the player laying it is
able to name it correctly, then all other players are immediately
forced to draw from the deck, thus making the Enid a useful weapon on
the player with only one card remaining.  (Incidentally, in this game,
Blackjack's traditional call of "Last card" is replaced by "Last St.
Francis of Assisi".  Forgetting this results, predictably, in being
forced to draw seven cards from the deck)

Naming the Enid is a more difficult task than it may seem, since each
time it is correctly named, the player playing adds another middle
name onto the list, which starts empty at the beginning of the session
of play  (Note: it is *not* re-zero'd between games - only at the
start of a whole new session)  Once four of five such middle names
have been added, it can become quite difficult to remember them all
(They must of course, be in the right order)

An example of a growing Enid, taken from the very first ever game of
Enid that we played, is:

	Enid Blyton
	Enid Flamboyant Blyton
	Enid Flamboyant Disjoint Blyton
	Enid Flamboyant Disjoint Ornithological Blyton
	Enid Flamboyant Disjoint Ornithological Aestheticism Blyton

A player attempting to lay the Enid, but unable accurately to name it
must draw a number of cards from the deck equal to the current tally
of middle names, and forfeits the right to add a new middle name.

Well, there you have it.  Curiously enough, this isn't *just* a set of
silly rules, but does actually make a frogging good game - it keeps us
amused for hours, and well repays the time taken in learning its
rules, which are, of course, fairly fluid.  I strongly urge you to
have a go.

If you play this game, please email me with any comments, ideas for
new rules, particularly good middle names for Enid Blyton, etc.  My
address is in my signature at the bottom of this article.
