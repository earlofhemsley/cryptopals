  Note 1 = Test yellow food color first by droping a drop of color onto white
           paper .  If the color stained is lemon yellow then use above ratio .
           If color is more orange than yellow then devide amount in half ( 1/2
           norm ) .
 
  Note 2 = If you add Kodak Photo-flo to the blood you cannot eat it .  The
           Photo-flo alows the blood to soak into cloth .
 
 
 
  Procedure - Get a bowl slightly large than volume of Karo syrop.  Add equal
amounts of zinc oxide and mix together.  Add color.  Mix well.  When color is
mixed in well add a bit of the syrop , mix well.  Continue until all the syrop
is mixed in.  Put in conatianer .
 
  Notes - If you want the blood to soak into fabrics then add the Photo-flo
when you add the colors.
 
  Keep blood cold.  It molds if left in warm area
 
  Mix before using.  The zinc oxide deposites at the bottom of the bottle if
not mixed .
 
  Zinc Oxide can be found at drug stores and chemical supply houses.  In small
doses it is harmless.
 
 
     To Darken   Add drops of green .
    To Thicken   Add small amounts of peanut butter.
       To Thin   Use above with Photo-flo , but match amounts of syrop with
                 water ie.  if recipe calls for 1 Q syrop then also add 1 Q
                 water .
